# MultiTrainer
Multiplication Trainer
Writes a program in python with a graphical interface that allows a child to improve multiplication calculations from 0 to maximum 10. All interactions between the child and the program must be done through the graphical interface. Asks at the beginning for the child's name or allows the user to be selected from a list if it's a returning user. Uses a CSV file as a database to store user names and scores and other information you consider important. In addition to the training mode, there is also a test mode that assesses the child's level by asking the student to perform random calculations for 8 minutes and counts the points: a correct answer equals +1, a wrong answer +0. At the end of the 8 minutes, the child will receive the result displayed on the screen. The results will be stored in the CSV file and when a user beats his record, the program congratulates him for this record. Writes the interface and all the messages always in French.
Subdivide the program into several files and start by giving the names of the files I should create. Then, when I type the name of the file, you will give me its content.
